### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a third-year at UChicago, interested in the intersection between software and security. I am looking for Fall 2021 internships in SWE, Application Security, and/or DevSecOps.

- ðŸ’» I've started a blog where I talk about Security and Privacy ideas at an accessible level. Check it out: https://oliviamorkved.tech (I also post academic/professional updates there).

- ðŸŒ± What I am currently learning: In Winter 2021 I was enrolled in Functional Programming and Computer Networks courses.
   In Fall 2020 I was enrolled in Computer Architecture and Cryptography courses.
